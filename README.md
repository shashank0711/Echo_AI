# Echo AI

Echo AI is a dual-functionality voice-driven app utilizes the Gemini API for generating intelligent responses and the Stability API for creating corresponding images to user voice inputs. Users receive both verbal and visual feedback, providing an enriched and interactive experience based on their voice commands.
